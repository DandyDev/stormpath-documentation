****************************
Multi-Tenancy with Stormpath
****************************

a. What Is a Multi-Tenant Application? 
======================================

Unlike most web applications that support a single company or organization with a tightly-coupled database, a **multi-tenant application** is a single application that services multiple organizations or tenants simultaneously. For privacy and security purposes, its very important that each tenant have its own private data partition. At Stormpath, this data partioning is baked-in to our data model. How do we do this? Well, it starts with an Organization.

b. Modelling Tenants in Stormpath
=================================

In our :ref:`Account Management <account-mgmt-header>` section we discussed two kinds of Account Stores: :ref:`Directories <directory-mgmt>`, and :ref:`Groups <group-mgmt>`. In multi-tenant applications there is an additional **Organization** resource, which functions like a virtual Account Store that itself wraps both Directories and Groups. 

Organizations
--------------

The Organization Resource
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An individual Organization resource may be accessed via its Resource URI:

**Directory URI**

``/v1/organizations/:organizationId``
